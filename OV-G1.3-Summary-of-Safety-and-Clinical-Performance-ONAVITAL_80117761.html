Device identification and general information </h3><p>Device trade name: ONAVITAL</p><p>Manufacturer; name and address  </p><p>Onalabs Inno-Hub SL, Avinguda del Parc Tecnologic, 3, Cerdanyola del Vallès, 08290, Barcelona</p><p>Basic UDI-DI 8437026494001</p><p>Year when the device was first CE-marked: 2024*</p><p>ONAVITAL TM is a wearable physical sensor bracelet worn by the patient/user including sensors and calibration algorithms for vital signs acquisition and adapters for data digitalization. It provides provides accurate and precise measurements of Pulse Rate (PR), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Systolic and Diastolic Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and Skin-surface Temperature (ST) through a wearable physical bracelet.</p><h3 id="OVG1.3SummaryofSafetyandClinicalPerformanceONAVITAL-2.Intendeduseofthedevice">2. Intended use of the device </h3><p>ONAVITAL by Onalabs Inno-hub SL is remote monitoring device for spot check collection of accurate measurements of Pulse Rate (PR), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and Skin Temperature (STEMP). ONAVITAL is intended for spot-checking and tracking vital signs of adult patients in general and cardiorespiratory patients in particular. </p><h4 id="OVG1.3SummaryofSafetyandClinicalPerformanceONAVITAL-Indicationsandintendedpatientgroups">Indications and intended patient groups  </h4><ol start="1"><li><p>Adult patients in general and cardiorespiratory patients in particular. Pulse oximeters can be used on most pediatrics to adults, however ONAVITAL has been designed exclusively for Adult users. </p></li><li><p>Patients that are not considered to be in a critical condition.</p></li></ol><p>ONAVITAL TM is intended to be used by patients that are not considered to be in a critical condition.</p><p>ONAVITAL TM can be used on any location where there is internet connectivity whether they are private residences or other environments such as nursing homes, primary care centres.</p><p>ONAVITAL provides:</p><ul><li><p>Remote spot-check measurement of patients' vital signs.</p></li><li><p>Remote measurement of oxygen saturation with accuracy (reported as Accuracy Root Mean Square or A<sub>rms</sub>)  within 4% of commercial medical grade pulsi oximeters arterial blood gas values. </p></li><li><p>Remote measurement of pulse rate with accuracy (reported as Mean Absolute Error) within 3BPM of commercial medical grade pulsi oximeters pulse rate values. </p></li><li><p>Remote measurement of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (reported as Standard Deviation) within 8 mmHg of commercial medical grade sphygmomanometer values. </p></li><li><p>Remote measurement of skin-surface temperature (reported as SD) within the 1ºC of commercial medical grade thermometers values.</p></li></ul><h4 id="OVG1.3SummaryofSafetyandClinicalPerformanceONAVITAL-Contraindications">Contraindications</h4><ul><li><p>People without the skills and competencies to operate the digital solution.</p></li><li><p>Pulse oximeters have limitations and a risk of inaccuracy under certain circumstances. In many cases, the level of inaccuracy may be small and not clinically meaningful; however, there is a risk that an inaccurate measurement may result in unrecognized low oxygen saturation levels.</p></li><li><p>The SpO<sub>2</sub> reading should always be considered an <em>estimate</em> of oxygen saturation. For example, if a pulse oximeter reads 90%, then the true oxygen saturation in the blood is generally between 86-94%. Pulse oximeter accuracy is highest at saturations of 90-100%, intermediate at 80-90%, and lowest below 80%.</p></li><li><p>Due to accuracy limitations at the individual level, SpO<sub>2</sub> provides more utility for trends over time instead of absolute thresholds.</p></li><li><p>Many patient factors may also affect the accuracy of the measurement. The most current scientific evidence shows that there are some accuracy differences in pulse oximeters between dark and light skin pigmentation; this difference is typically small at saturations above 80% and greater when saturations are less than 80%.</p></li><li><p>Wireless pulse oximeters do not have unlimited range. To work effectively the wireless oximeter must be in Bluetooth range of the device they are communicating with.</p></li><li><p>Do not use with neonatal patients.</p></li><li><p>If the device is mechanically damaged it must not be used and must be disposed.</p></li><li><p>The device have been designed and evaluated to be used in adults, do not use on paediatrics.</p></li><li><p>Do not use with patients with significant deformity, swelling, irritation, degenerative changes or edema of<br/>the wrist.</p></li><li><p>Do not use the wrist monitor on patients with localized infection, ulceration or skin lesions involving the wrist.</p></li><li><p>Do not use the wrist monitor on patients that have restricted blood flow e.g. tourniquet, pressure cuff or IV line.</p></li><li><p>Do not use with patients with tremors or convulsions.</p></li><li><p>Do not use with patients with peripheral vascular disease affecting the hands.</p></li><li><p>Do not use on an area with a tattoo.</p></li><li><p>DO NOT use in MRI or a CT environment.</p></li></ul><h3 id="OVG1.3SummaryofSafetyandClinicalPerformanceONAVITAL-4.Accessories">4.

This device contains WEEE materials; please contact your distributor regarding return or recycling of the device.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Real-world accuracy may differ from accuracy in the lab setting. While reported accuracy is an average of all patients in the test sample, there are individual variations among patients. The SpO<sub>2</sub> reading should always be considered an <em>estimate</em> of oxygen saturation. For example, if a pulse oximeter reads 90%, then the true oxygen saturation in the blood is generally between 86-94%.

Possible diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives</h3><p>When considering alternative treatments, it is recommended to contact your healthcare professional who can take into account your individual situation. While ONAVITAL can be used for non-invasive monitoring, several alternative approaches exist for assessing more specific conditions. Some common therapeutic alternatives include:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Obtaining a sample of arterial blood allows for direct measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, as well as pH and other blood gas parameters.<br/>Use Cases: Often employed in critical care settings or situations where precise oxygenation and acid-base status are crucial.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Capnography:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Measures the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in exhaled breath, providing insights into respiratory function and ventilation.<br/>Use Cases: Useful in monitoring patients under anesthesia, during mechanical ventilation, and in emergency situations.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Lung Auscultation:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Listening to breath sounds using a stethoscope to assess lung function, detect abnormalities, and infer potential respiratory issues.<br/>Use Cases: Often employed in routine physical examinations and in identifying conditions like pneumonia or bronchitis.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Pulse Palpation and Auscultation:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Assessing blood pressure indirectly by feeling peripheral pulses or listening to Korotkoff sounds using a stethoscope.<br/>Use Cases: Common in routine clinical examinations, particularly when immediate numerical values may not be required.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (IBP) Monitoring:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Directly measuring blood pressure by inserting a catheter into an artery, typically the radial or femoral artery.<br/>Use Cases: Common in critical care settings, surgery, or situations where continuous and precise blood pressure monitoring is essential.</p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>Central Venous Pressure (CVP) Monitoring:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Measuring the pressure in the central venous circulation, typically through a catheter placed in a large vein, such as the superior vena cava.<br/>Use Cases: Used to assess fluid status and guide fluid administration, especially in critically ill patients.</p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Manual Sphygmomanometer with Doppler:</strong></p></li></ol><p>Description: Combining a traditional blood pressure cuff with a Doppler ultrasound device to assess blood pressure in patients with challenging anatomy or limited access.<br/>Use Cases: Common in vascular assessments and in situations where standard cuff-based measurements are difficult.</p><p>These therapeutic alternatives cater to diverse clinical scenarios, providing healthcare professionals with a range of tools to assess and manage patients' vital signs status beyond PPG non-invasive technology. The choice of method depends on the specific clinical context, patient condition, and monitoring requirements, where the expert clinicians can choose from.</p><h3 id="OVG1.3SummaryofSafetyandClinicalPerformanceONAVITAL-7.Suggestedtrainingforusers">7.
